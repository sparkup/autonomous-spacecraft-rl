    "# Mission - PPO Baseline for Descent Control (LunarLander-v3)\n",
    "\n",
    "This mission is the main space-oriented demonstration: an agent learns to stabilize and land a module on a target pad.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operational objective\n",
    "Build a robust **PPO baseline** that serves as a reference for later improvements (hyperparameters, training budgets, multi-run comparisons).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Consistency with the launch sequence\n",
    "- Launch 1: RL loop and random baseline\n",
    "- Launch 2: tabular learning\n",
    "- Launch 3: deep value approximation\n",
    "- Mission: deep RL for practical descent-control behavior\n"

    "## Scientific Justification (Mission Level)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why PPO over DQN / SAC in this context?\n",
    "PPO is chosen for this mission baseline because it provides a strong stability/performance trade-off for iterative policy improvement:\n",
    "- **Clipped surrogate objective** to prevent destructive updates\n",
    "- Robust optimization behavior across seeds\n",
    "- Practical reproducibility with standard SB3 tooling\n",
    "- Strong empirical reliability on benchmark control tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "DQN is valuable in discrete-action deep RL but is more sensitive to replay/target tuning in this workflow. SAC is powerful, but PPO gives a simpler and more controlled first mission baseline for this portfolio scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LunarLander-v3?\n",
    "LunarLander-v3 is used as a **structured proxy** for descent guidance because it provides:\n",
    "- Nonlinear coupled dynamics\n",
    "- Explicit state variables for control reasoning\n",
    "- Reward components aligned with soft-landing objectives\n",
    "- Benchmark comparability and reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reward design and shaping interpretation\n",
    "We interpret reward as a multi-objective signal balancing:\n",
    "- Touchdown success\n",
    "- Attitude stability\n",
    "- Velocity moderation\n",
    "- Control-effort efficiency\n",
    "- Crash penalties\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is not merely to maximize return numerically, but to encourage physically plausible and repeatable landing behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variance management and statistical credibility\n",
    "Variance is handled through:\n",
    "- Controlled seeding\n",
    "- Repeated evaluation episodes\n",
    "- Moving-average smoothing on dashboard plots\n",
    "- Dispersion-aware interpretation (std, confidence intuition)\n",
    "- Cross-run comparison instead of single-score claims\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation limitations (explicit)\n",
    "This environment does not model real flight stack complexity:\n",
    "- No high-fidelity aerodynamics/turbulence\n",
    "- No realistic sensor noise pipeline (IMU/GNSS fusion)\n",
    "- No actuator latency/saturation/failure logic\n",
    "- No embedded real-time constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore results are **algorithmic evidence**, not flight qualification evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sim2Real gap and forward path\n",
    "A credible transfer strategy would require:\n",
    "1. Domain randomization (mass, thrust, disturbances, delays)\n",
    "2. Robustness envelopes and worst-case testing\n",
    "3. Safety constraints and guarded policy execution\n",
    "4. Staged transfer to higher-fidelity simulators\n",
    "5. Hardware-in-the-loop and incremental validation\n",
    "\n",
    "This mission notebook should be read as a rigorous RL baseline and methodology demonstration, not as direct deployability proof.\n"
