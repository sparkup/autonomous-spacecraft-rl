    "- Instantiate a Gymnasium environment and verify its behavior\n",
    "- Interpret the observation and action spaces\n",
    "- Run a random policy as a reference baseline\n",
    "- Observe the interaction dynamics: state -> action -> reward -> next state\n",

    "## Scientific Justification (Phase 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why not PPO yet in Launch 1?\n",
    "Launch 1 is intentionally a **foundational phase**: we first validate the RL loop, state/action semantics, and instrumentation on a simple benchmark before introducing higher-complexity policy optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, the objective is **experimental reliability**, not final mission performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reward definition and interpretation in this phase\n",
    "The episode return is used as the primary outcome variable. Even with a random policy, we explicitly track reward trajectories to establish:\n",
    "- A lower-bound baseline\n",
    "- Variance patterns across episodes\n",
    "- Whether metrics/logging are trustworthy for later launches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variance handling (initial level)\n",
    "We already control variance through:\n",
    "- Repeated episodes\n",
    "- Aggregated statistics over runs\n",
    "- Deterministic plotting and reproducible code paths\n",
    "\n",
    "This prepares the statistical discipline used in later launches (seed control, smoothing, confidence bands).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limits of the simulation at this stage\n",
    "This phase uses a simplified benchmark and therefore does **not** capture:\n",
    "- High-fidelity flight dynamics\n",
    "- Actuator/sensor delays\n",
    "- Realistic disturbances (wind, vibration, turbulence)\n",
    "- Hardware constraints and fault modes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sim2Real perspective\n",
    "No direct transfer claim is made from Launch 1. The phase is a controlled methodological step that reduces implementation risk before moving to deeper RL and mission-like dynamics.\n"
